# Launch Date & Goals: The Best Time to Start a Kickstarter (and how much to ask for!)

## Overview of Project
A request to better understand if there is a correlation between when a Kickstarter Campaign is launched and how much the goal amount is, as it pertains to whether or not the campaign is successful. Specifically, we are looking to answer this question for the subcategory of 'plays'. 
### Purpose 
Providing better insight and understanding the correlation between the launch date of a Kickstarter Campaign and the Goal amount requested can help make a more informed decisions on when to launch a campaign and how much to set the goal for. This information may also help with the scheduling of plays, especially if we are relying on money from Kickstarter Campaigns to get the shows up and running.
