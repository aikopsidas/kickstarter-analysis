# Launch Date & Goals: The Best Time to Start a Kickstarter (and how much to ask for!)

## Overview of Project
A request to better understand if there is a correlation between when a Kickstarter Campaign is launched and how much the goal amount is, as it pertains to whether or not the campaign is successful. Specifically, we are looking to answer this question for the subcategory of 'plays'. 
### Purpose 
Providing better insight and understanding the correlation between the launch date of a Kickstarter Campaign and the Goal amount requested can help make a more informed decisions on when to launch a campaign and how much to set the goal for. This information may also help with the scheduling of plays, especially if we are relying on money from Kickstarter Campaigns to get the shows up and running. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The data (Kickstarter_data tab in the attached excel file** add link?) was ready to be used for data analysis, except for the addition of a year column which was added so that the first set of our analysis could be viewed by month. To achieve the data analysis results for the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' tab and visualization a 'countifs' formula need to be creaeted to pull only the data we want to review. To ensure that there were no errors when pulling the data from the Kickstarter_data tab I created refernece cells so that the formulas were pulling the same data for each cell.--- 
    * Row 1 has 'successful', 'failed', and 'canceled' (in cells D1,E1,F1) 
    * Columns A & B have '>=' and '<=' values assocaiated with goal row
These refernce ensure that there are no spelling errors and errors on the goal references in the formulas used.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
